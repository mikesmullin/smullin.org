Birth and Early Childhood</B></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.06in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They
say there is always a beginning to every tale and this one begins in
a small town called Clay Center Kansas, where this person, Ralph
Smullin, was born on the twenty-second of January, Nineteen-Hundred
and Ten. My parents, Fred and Florence Smullin, were poor but proud,
and lived on the bank of a creek. My father worked for the Telephone
Company and he earned between fifteen and twenty dollars a month.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.06in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>I
don't remember too much about my earliest childhood and rely on my
parents to fill it in.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; ">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">There was the time when they were taking us across the creek to my Grandmother's place,
which was on the high ground across from our place. Dad took me out of the boat and sat me up on the bank and turned around to get my sister.
I fell over backwards into the creek and they did some exciting grabbing for me in order to fish me out of the water.</FONT>
</P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; ">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">I
was always clumsy and my father thought he would never teach me to
pick up my feet so I wouldn't fall over them.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; ">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">My
father said that I was afraid of animals. We would be walking down
the street when he would see a horse and would try to put himself
between the horse and me. I would peer around him and start
squawking, which would make dad so disgusted at me. He wasn't very
happy about the whole affair.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; ">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">I
do remember when he and my uncles would put up ice in the wintertime.
They had a long saw with a long handle on one end, and at the front,
a clevis hooked to a horse. One of them drove the horse while the
other guided the saw with the handle. They would cut blocks out of
the creek in this way, and float them down the creek to a hoist. The
hoist carried them up the bank to the ice cellar where they covered
each layer with sawdust.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.06in; ">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">I
also remember when the folks had the telephone girls over to the
house for an ice skating party. They built a big fire on the bank,
skated up and down on the creek and had a marshmallow roast before
going home.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; ">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">Two
boys had been skating together and I remember one of them had fallen
on his skate and split his lip. The folks called the doctor, who came
to he house in those days, and sewed up the boy's lip. (We didn't
have a hospital and all of us kids were born at home.)</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; ">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">I
also remember one Thanksgiving, as we were beginning our dinner, an
old man was brought in, who had been riding on top of a load of hay.
He had been drug off he load of hay as they were going under the
telephone wires on the corner.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.08in">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">Once
again, the doctor was called but the doctor said he would be all
right as soon as the old man got his wind and got over the shock of
the fall. The old man had been wearing a heavy coat and fur cap,
which kept him from getting, hurt any worse than he did.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>On
Sunday we had to polish our shoes and button them with a button hook
which was the latest fashion in footwear at the time. We had to wear
our garter belts which was a harness that fit over your shoulder and
around your mid section and finally down to the stockings which came
all the way up to the hips.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>They

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Kansas
was one of the first states to go dry and the last one to go wet
again.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>We
had some friends called Openlanders whose children we played with. A
man called Warren that worked on the telephone crew with dad had
three children that we played with. I had a Negro boy friend that
lived up the road that I played with.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>I
would watch his father pull snapping turtles from the creek after a
cloudburst. The creek was formed from the backwaters of the
Republican River. The only time the creek was active was when the
river would rise due to a storm somewhere along the Republican River.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>One
time, my mother took my sister and I to Topeka to visit some
relatives. During our stay, the creek rose and flooded the house,
coming to the door before receding. My father said that the telephone
rang at two o'clock in the morning.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
he jumped out of bed to answer the phone he lit in two inches of
water. The man on the other end had called dad to let him know the
creek was rising, to which dad replied that by then he was well aware
of it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>When
we got back all our things, which they were able to save, were at
grandmother's house. We had a sister born about this time, named Ruby</FONT></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in; margin-bottom: 0.08in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>Marie,
but she caught a cold, which turned to pneumonia, and she died. The
doctor told my folks that if my sister, Viola and my mother, were
going to live very long they would have to leave that damp climate.
So, in Nineteen-Sixteen, my father and his friend, Warren heard that
the railroad was building shops at Pocatello, Idaho and hiring men.</FONT></FONT></P>

Ho</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Dad and his friend, Warren, hopped freight and got
jobs working in the railroad shop in Pocatello. In the summer of
Seventeen, after obtaining pass rights, they sent for their families.
So, we came out to Pocatello, Idaho. We had to give up our dog, Pearl
we called her, and some of our other things because we couldn't take
them all. It mad us sad, at the time, but we eventually got over it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We rode on the train, which was the way you
traveled in those days, if you had a long distance to go. The train
stopped at every way station along the way so you wanted to pack in a
fair sized lunch if you were going very far. At every town, of any
size, there would be guys get on the train with trays full of
Crackerjacks, gum, Hershey Bars, Lifesavers and drinks, for which you
had to provide our own container. Back of them would be a man selling
comics, magazines and papers. A nickel was a lot of money, in those
days, so you didn't get much of that stuff.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I told the folks back home that I was going to get
me a bear when got out west, which seemed to amuse them all. I don't
remember just how I figured on getting this done but when you are
that age it doesn't seem to mater much. The untamed west wasn't all I
had imagined it to be anyway. There were no shoot-outs, no cowboys
with six guns, just another town in a different part of the country.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When we arrived in Pocatello my father had rented
a frame house on the corner where J C Penny now stands on main
street. My father worked on the railroad and my mother took in
boarders, serving them dinner family style. Later on, my mother went
to work for the Woolworth store so. Viola and I had to look out for
ourselves after we got home from school.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The first day we went to school we were directed
to the school, which was both grade school and high school. It was a
block up the street. The reason I remembered it so well was because
my sister and I came down the wrong side of the street, when we came
out of the school, and we were lost.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">An officer came around the corner and we asked him
where our house was. When we told him who we were, he pointed across
the street and said, &quot;Right there!&rdquo; Everyone called him
Officer Duffy.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We always said we didn't want to be caught after
eight o'clock at night because there was an eight o'clock curfew for
anyone under sixteen. Well, the owners of the house sold their
property to the man who owned the Golden Rule store, so we had to
move. We moved down on Harrison Street into a small, two-room house,
which was one of four that had been built to form a U-shape. In this
U was a community toilet and also a hydrant for all of the renters.
The Warrens lived next door to us and we played together.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I remember the big <A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote1anc" HREF="#sdfootnote1sym"><SUP>1</SUP></A>eclipse
of that year. It was kind of a disappointment to me because <A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote2anc" HREF="#sdfootnote2sym"><SUP>2</SUP></A>I
thought it was going to last a lot longer than it did. I didn't take
into consideration the speed or distance of the sun.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I guess it was about this time that the Flu
epidemic hit. A lot of people, back east, lost their lives. I don't
remember very many people around our town dying but it had everyone
scared and living in fear of it anyway.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">The
folks got a builders set for me and I made a wagon to pull around by
a string. I also got the idea of putting a candle on it and pulling
it around in the dark. I was having a big time with it until I pulled
it into the kitchen, got too close to it, and set my pant leg on
fire. I let out a big howl and the folks came running to see what was
wrong. Dad picked up the bucket of water from the stand and dumped it
on top of me which got me all wet but put out the fire. I was scared
but outside of that no damage was done, except to my clothes.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">My folks didn't have money enough to buy fresh
milk. All we knew for a long time was canned milk from the store. I
talked the folks into getting a bottle of milk from the store and
that was quite a treat. For us, it was the same as dessert.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">My Father had a piece of steel fly up and put one
of his eyes out while working in the shops. After that they put him
in the wrecker crew as a cook.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">It was time for us to move again and this time we
moved way out on Garfield Street. While we were living there, the
foreman on the gang where my father worked came and told my mother
that my father had been injured in an accident. They had sent him
down to Salt Lake and they didn't expect him to live. He had been
working on the job helping to load power poles with the wrecker
crane. The crane operator raised the load of poles before the men
were ready and the poles came loose. One of them fell on my father&rsquo;s
chest and legs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">They put <A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote3anc" HREF="#sdfootnote3sym"><SUP>3</SUP></A>him
in a boxcar with another man who was being sent to the hospital in
Salt Lake also. If it had not been for the other man being able to
look after my father, he would have died. The other man told him to
look after my father, as he needed him worse.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">My mother asked the neighbors if they would look
after us, in case we needed anything. She told us to be good and what
to do in case we needed anything and took off for Salt Lake. It took
two weeks for Mother to return home because it took them that long to
get father back on the road to recovery. He was going to make it, so
Mother came home to see how we were getting along and went back to be
with Father when they released him from the hospital.</P>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in"><font face="Arial">While we were living on Garfield Street, my grandfather
Anderson came to be with us for awhile. He worked for the city and
paid mother for his board and room. My mother never felt that he was
her father because when her mother died giving birth to her youngest
brother, he didn't want to be bothered with the kids. He was crazy
about women and wanted to be free to play the field, so he adopted
out the youngest ones and the oldest ones were put in foster homes
where they had to work for their keep.
</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in">
</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Mother was twelve at the time. She was with a
Dutch family, on a farm where she was injured in a cyclone. She was
always afraid of being caught in another. When we lived in Kansas,
whenever a hard wind would start to come up, she would gather us up
and head for the cellar.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">After my father went back to work, they bought a
small house at 1124 north Arthur, in the rear of 1128, and we lived
there until 1929.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We had a hard time holding on to a nickel. There
were ice cream peddlers that had two wheeled carts with a horse
hitched to them. They would go around with a tinkling bell to tell of
their arrival. Whenever we had a nickel in our little mitts, we were
suckers for ice cream cones.</P>

RETURN VISIT TO KANSAS</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We also used to chase after the ice cream man when
he came to deliver ice. They didn't have refrigerators then, just ice
boxes. They had cards furnished by the ice company with numbers on
them. So if you wanted fifty lbs of ice, you turned up the corner
with fifty on it and put it in the window. As the iceman went by, he
would know how much ice to deliver and while he was delivering, we
would grab all the loose chips on the back of his wagon and take off.
Some didn't mind but some were pretty cranky about it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Mother took us on a trip back to Kansas to see the
folks. We went out to visit our cousin Albert Sparman at Greenland.
Cousin Albert had a Fordson tractor and he was going to pull a drag
up and down the road to smooth it down. (Every farmer was charged
with keeping up the road that went by his place.)</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I asked Albert if I could ride on the drag. He
said yes so I had a good time until we got back. When my mother got a
good look at me, she had put clean cloths on me that morning, she
didn&rsquo;t appreciate the way I looked.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I liked to watch one of his mules come in out of
the pasture in the evening. He would reach his head through the upper
part of the barn door, unlatch the lower half, walk in and get his
oats. The others would let him take lead and after he opened the
door, they would follow him in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When we got back home, we got to take a ride in
our new model T Ford that Dad had bought while we were gone. The
first thing mother noticed was a broken radiator in the shed. Dad
said that he had intended to get rid of it before we got back but we
came home sooner than he expected. The second day he got it he was
taking the minister and his wife out for a ride at night and an
Indian scared up some horses along side of the road. One of them
tried to run between the head lights and bent the radiator. He paid a
total four hundred and seventy five dollars for it brand new. I don&rsquo;t
know of any other car we got more pleasure out of. It had oil light
for the tail lamp and parking lights but the headlights were electric
and run off the magneto.</P>

MEMORIES OF CHILDHOOD</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We were members of the Babtist church in Clay
Center so when we came to Pocatello we joined the church here. We had
quite the experiences there and we got well acquainted with the
minister and his family. My sister and I joined a club headed by the
minister&rsquo;s son and we put on a drive to raise funds. The most
notable one was a play that we put on in the shed in back of the
minister&rsquo;s house. We made a stage in back of it and cut the
ends out of some cans and put candles in them for stage lights. I
don't remember what the play was all about but we had a full house
and had a lot of fun doing it. We took all of our proceeds and bought
a lot of groceries for an elderly couple that was having a hard time.
We got our Folks to go with us and throw a surprise party for them
with the groceries. It was a big success and we all had a good time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I remember that one summer our family and the
minister&rsquo;s family went to the Babtist assembly grounds above
Ketchum. They had a model T one-year-older than ours. I'll never
forget excitement and joy on the minister&rsquo;s face when he got
there. He jumped out of his car and ran back to Dad and said, &ldquo;Fred,
I made it in high gear all the way, how did you?&quot; Dad said, &quot;So
did I.&quot; just as happily. We stayed there a few days and Dad
decided to go home by way of Galena summit which was a steep, winding
road. Part of the way up it our car quit because it didn't have a
fuel pump. The gas had to run in by gravity and the hill was so steep
that it wouldn't run into the carburetor. So, we got out and turned
the car around and backed it up the hill. The gas tank was under the
seat and with the front end going down hill, instead of up, the gas
flowed all right. When he got to the top, he stopped and waited for
us to reach the top where we all piled in and went on our merry way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We camped at Alturist Lake at then at Red Fish
Lake and finally back home by way of Idaho Falls. We had a great time
in those days. Camping out meant camping by an open fire to cook and
sleeping in a tent built for a half a dozen but it was great.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Soon after this was when the shop and yardmen went
on strike. It included dad and hard times really set in for us. Dad
worked at potato cellars and any other job he could find. We ate
spuds in every manner you could think of.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in"><font face="Arial">My mother had one of those washing machines with a handle on
top that you pushed back and forth to run it. Mother would build a
fire in the cook stove and put the boiler on full of water and then
cut up a bar of brown laundry soap in it. When the soapy water got
hot she would pour it over the clothes in the machine. Then came the
time that my sister and I hated. We had to take turns working the
washing machine handle. Mother usually had three loads to do and
sometimes extra such as blankets and sheets.</font></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">My father was a member of the Woodsman of the
World Lodge. The lodge decided to have a picnic at Mack&rsquo;s Inn
with concessions that sold ice cream, pop and the like. Dad was given
the pop stand to look after. So, we loaded up the car and took off
for Mack&rsquo;s Inn. We had quite a time up there for the next two
weeks.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">They wouldn&rsquo;t let anyone pay cash for what
they got. They had to buy tickets as they came onto the grounds and
use them. Whenever we wanted something from one of the other stands,
we would reach under the counter and get a ticket. As I recall we
faired pretty good. It was a picnic for us and we really enjoyed
camping out.

<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The lady who lived with her sister in the front

<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I had quite a few friends around the neighborhood.
and a boy down the street had quite a few. We were rivals until our
mothers, mine especially, asked us why we couldn&rsquo;t join
together and be friends. We decided it would be a good thing and we
became the best of friends.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">After that, <I>we</I> did many things together
such as the time when the 0'Henry bar came out to advertise. They put
out five pound bars stores around town to be awarded to the person or
persons turning in the most candy bar wrappers. So we all scoured the
neighborhood where we lived and gathered up enough to win the one at
our store. After we divided it up, we all had a slice of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Red, was latter to become fire chief of Pocatello.
He went by several names. We called him Red on account of his red

<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I always wanted a bicycle but never had the money
to get one. Red had a frame of one with the back wheel on it and he
sold it to me for three dollars. Dad got me a front wheel and. tire
for it. I really was proud of it. I made several trips to the dumps
and picked <I>up</I> extras to put on it. It was the only bicycle I
ever owned. Red and I fancied up our outfits and he painted them both
just alike as he was quite an artist.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I was to have mine stolen from school. It was more
than a year before I found it. One of my friends saw the back wheel
to it in the bike shop. It had the only racing sprocket on it in
town. Some man had brought it in to have the spokes tightened. So I
told dad and he had the police pick <I>up </I>the man <I>who</I> said
he had bought it from a kid. The kid said he found it under a bridge.
I got it back in pieces and had to start all over again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I made cars and airplanes out of wood and sold
them to the kids around the neighborhood. Of course we had our
sessions of cowboys and robbers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When I was twelve I joined the Boy Scouts. One
Xmas vacation the scout master called and wanted to know if I would
go on a hike with some of the other boys up Pocatello Creek for five
days. My folks said I could so they loaded me down with food and
blankets and we took off over the hill from the University or Tech as
it was known then.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We hiked and carried all our stuff to a shack on
the creek that belonged to a bootlegger. He didn&rsquo;t mind because
he was serving out a sentence for bootlegging in the pen. It had a
roof over it but the windows were all broken out and I remember
getting up in the morning and having to shake the snow out of our
shoes before we could put them on. But, we had a good time hiking and
learning how to get along. In the winter our load wasn&rsquo;t so
heavy coming home as we had eaten every thing we took but we still
had a good hike home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">One of my good friends, Robert Tout, that lived on
the corner and I decided to make like Eskimos one winter and we built
an igloo in our yard. We banked up around part of our lawn and
flooded it to make a skating rink and had some fun with it that
winter.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I remember one when Red and I and Robert and <I>the</I>
Walters boy decided to get together and ride our bicycles to Indian
springs just the other side of American Falls and go swimming. So we
go up at four in the morning and headed out on our trip of thirty
miles. The Walters boy was working for a gum ball vending outfit <I>so</I>
he brought along four boxes of gum balls for us to chew. Each box
contained a hundred so we chewed gum all the way up there and back.
We chewed them long enough to get all the candy taste out of them and
take another one.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When we got to American Falls, we had to push our
bikes through part of the town as they were just moving it up on the
hill out of the way of the dam. Things were pretty well tore up but
we made it to the springs in pretty good time and had our swim.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">After we ate our lunch, we headed back home and if
my memory serves me right, we got back at six o&rsquo;clock that
evening. We were told to get <I>back</I> before dark and we made it
all right.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I was at Lava for a swim a few years back and a
fellow came up to me and said, &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you Ralph
Smullin?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I said, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in"><I>He continued, </I>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem
to know me but remember when we took that bike ride to Indian
Springs?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">It was the Walters boy and he said, &ldquo;We had
quite a time, didn&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;. He recognized me but I sure
never recognized him &lsquo;till he told me who he was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I also remember one time when Robert and I went on
an overnight hike over Kimport Peak and down into Midnight Valley. <I>We</I>
camped in a little lean-to we had built and we had this big red dog
and a neighbor&rsquo;s black dog with us. In the middle of the night
the dogs began to growl and make a fuss. We kept trying to get them
to shut up and settle down but they wouldn&rsquo;t. All of a sudden
they let out a bark and came bouncing in on top of us. At the same
time we heard a loud scream from behind a log about fifty feet from
us. Looking over there we saw two pair of eyes looking at us from 
over the logs. It was a pair of mountain lions that was hanging
around in that part of the hills.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We were a couple of scared boys I&rsquo;ll tell
you. We didn&rsquo;t close our eyes much the rest of the night but
they never bothered us any more. But, if you have never heard a
cougar scream before, it is one experience you won&rsquo;t soon
forget. <I>We</I> figured they were after the dogs and then caught
our scent and moved on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">All of us kids around the neighborhood hiked all
around. the hills around Pocatello. Each one was a different
experience for us. We also played baseball on the vacant lot across
the street. We <I>were</I> unfortunate enough to break a window once
but other than that, we didn&rsquo;t cause any trouble.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We used to have races around the block on our
roller skates and coaster wagons. We used to make stilts and walk
around on them. We stomped in milk cans and walked on them as they
would bend  around the middle part of the shoe and hang on until we
knocked them off. (Not recommended for</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">tennis shoes however.) We made skate boards out of
a piece of two-by-four, an old skate and an apple box. And, <I>we</I>
had quite a time with them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I remember one day I borrowed. my friend&rsquo;s
wagon that had iron wheels on it an went coasting around the block.
About the fifth time around the man from the lumber company came out
and turned me around and told me that he didn&rsquo;t want to hear me
coming around with that noise maker again. I thought, at the time,
that he was a mean old man but as I look back on it I can see what he
was going through.</P>

MINISTERS AND SCHOOLS</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The minister quit at the church and they had a
minister, Reverend Nieler, from New York come to take over until they
could decide on a replacement. My folks took him down to Lava Hot
Springs and we went to a restaurant to get dinner and the minister
swore that the cook had to go out an run down a critter an butcher it
before he could cook our dinner it took so long. I think it had been
so long since he had anyone order a meal there that he didn&rsquo;t
know how to go about it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The church decided to hire a minister by the name
of Jones. He was a good minister and had a real nice wife and
daughter named Larue but he didn&rsquo;t preach the way the big shots
wanted him to. They threw rocks through the window one night while we
were having services and it split the church. Part of us rented an
old building downtown and fixed it up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">There was an old gum ball machine hanging on the
outside of the building. Two other boys and I decided. that it had
some pennies left in it yet so we tore it off the building and went
to work on it. We really worked on that lock. Finally a man came cut
of the building an showed us how to go about it. We got it open and,
if I remember right, it had around three dollars worth of pennies in
it. Well worth the time we put in it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We had a scout troop, number 17, and the minister
came out and said that the American Legion was giving a big scout
record book as a prize for the troop that picked the most flowers for
them to put on the graves. We got in his model T and went up on the
hill as we had an early spring that year. The hills were covered with
beautiful flowers that year an <I>we filled the model T </I>full. We
rode back on the running boards, made two trips and came home with
the prize. The troop used it for a long time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">While we lived on Arthur street, we went to the
Lincoln school three blocks up the street <I>which is </I>now a
shopping center. We did things then that they don&rsquo;t do now;
such as when the bell rang, we gathered around the flag pole in the
morning while the monitor raised the flag. We pledged allegiance to
the flag after which we lined up in front of the steps. A couple of
the girls played a march on the piano as we marched to our rooms. In
the spring, the girls played hopscotch and jacks <I>while</I> the
boys played marbles and spun tops.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We also observed May Day. We would make baskets,
put little favors in them, put them on our friend&rsquo;s porch,
knock on the door and run so they wouldn&rsquo;t know who it was.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When we got out of the seventh grade, we went to
the Irving Jr High which they had just built so as to take some of
the load off the high school.</P>

AND ODD JOBS</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">It was about this time that I took on a paper
route on the Journal which had just started up. It paid big money;
three dollars a week.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">It was a morning paper and I had to get up at four
in the morning, go downtown <I>to</I> get my papers and deliver them
out on my route. Father always said that he should have half my pay
for getting me up in the morning. After I had been there for some
time, the boy that had the route next to mine, which was west
Pocatello and Sleepy Hollow, and the boss told me that there wasn&rsquo;t
enough papers there to justify another route. So, if I would add it
to mine he would pay me four dollars a week. So, I snapped it up and
I was the highest paid carrier on the paper.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The neighbor boy, Robert Tout, had a big red
Chesapeake dog and <I>the dog</I> liked to follow me on the route. He
was a lot of company for me so we went <I>on</I> the route together
&lsquo;till one morning when we were in Sleepy Hollow. Red went
around this one house and I heard a big scream. A woman came out of
the house and came out to the walk holding a day old chick, one of a
bunch she had in a brooder at the side of the house. Red had big feet
and evidently one of he chicks got out and when he ran around the
house he stepped on it.  
</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">She stood there and said, &ldquo;Your dog killed
one of my chickens. What are you going to do about it?&rdquo; 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">As it looked like it could. have been dead before
we got there, I said I wasn&rsquo;t going to do anything about it and
went on about my route. That day she called my boss and the Chief of
Police. So, the boss <I>said</I> I had better leave him at home. When
my dad came home that night, he said the Chief had asked him to tell
me to leave the dog at home so we parted company. All this fuss over
a three cent chick but maybe it was worth it to her.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We had quite the time at the paper. The press room
was in the basement of a two story building that had business firms
at the ground level and apartments above. There was a freight shoot
in the alley where all the supplies were delivered. We would walk
down it to the press room to get our papers. The building was across
from the post office. One of the renters in the building was the
Orpheum Candy and Fountain and they decided to move down on Main
Street next to the theater. The movers missed taking a basket of
salted peanuts but the carriers had eagle eyes for something like
that and needless to say it didn&rsquo;t last long. Everybody&rsquo;s
bag had. a goodly amount of salted peanuts in it. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">One weekend, the boss told us to come down to the
office and he would have the money to pay us. So, we were all there
at the specified. time <I>when</I> the woman in the office told us
that the boss wanted us to wait in the press room for him as he was
out collecting from his advertisers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">So, we were down there trying to be good but as
time went by we grew restless. One of the boys picked up one of the
papers and threw it at one of the others. Well it just seemed natural
for us to have a paper fight. Some of us got in the ammonia room
where they had the pump for the meat market upstairs. (It was at the
bottom of the stairs coming from the market.) Some of us got in the
stairway and the rest of us got behind the press.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The battle raged on &lsquo;till the noise alerted
the man in the market and he came down to see what it was all about.
After wadding through papers he mediated a settlement but quick. We
finally got our money but that was the last time we had to wait like
that for it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Besides filling the ammonia room and stairs full
we had several papers sticking out of the web of the press, It was an
old platen type of press.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">One of the boys that lived across the street,
Floyd Britton, carried papers too but he was an only child and his
mother really babied him. One report card day he tried to change the
marks on his report card which were bad. His mother caught him at it
and told him off. That evening he came home from school and took a
shot of formaldehyde.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The man who boarded with them came home in time to
call the doctor and save his life. The doctor said another thirty
minutes and it would have been too late. His mother tried to make it
look like an accident but it wasn&rsquo;t. He was going to teach his
folks a lesson but he was glad it didn&rsquo;t work. He realized he
wouldn&rsquo;t be around to see their suffering anyway.</P>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in"><font face="Arial">In those days we didn&rsquo;t have radio around Pocatello and
of course no TV. Can you imagine trying to study or work in all that
quiet. I remember that it was an exciting day when the folks put away
the old cylinder playing Edison and went down and bought a modern
platter playing Victrola and  the big hit record of' that year was
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Forever Blowing Bubbles&rdquo;. </font></p>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The paper got in a big board about eight feet
square that had a baseball diamond on it and a track around the
bases. <I>There were </I>squares <I>for runners </I>they could move
around the <I>bases</I> and there was a big bat at home plate that
they moved whenever a batter would strike. There was a metal ball on
a wire that would move the ball in the same direction that it was
hit. The plays would come in over the wire and be enacted on the
board. They only used it at world series time <I>whi</I>ch drew large
crowds of people.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The police department rope off the street so the
people could watch it. A man even put up bleachers across the street
and made a little money at it. There was a vacant lot back of the
telephone company that he used. They hired our coach to help them
with it. As we of the first period gym glass after dinner had no one
to look after us we went down to the game and watched it. Didn&rsquo;t
want to waste the time hanging around the gym.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We had a little trouble at school about this time.
The board had hired a new principal from a school in Chicago and he
was trying to use the same tactics that he used in Chicago. We
weren&rsquo;t really that bad but he was a grumpy fellow and nothing
seemed to please him. One day I went home to dinner and laid down on
the couch and went to sleep. Mother never noticed me until one
o&rsquo;clock. She told me to get going as I was late for school.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I jumped on my bicycle and raced to school. As I
had study hall the first period, I was going to sneak in the assembly
hall and not be seen but I opened the door and bumped into the
monitor. He told me to go and get an excuse so I went down to the
office. Debolt, the principal, asked me what I wanted and I said,
&ldquo;Give me a yellow excuse for being late.&rdquo; It meant that
you had to stay a half hour after school.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in"> As he was making it out a kid who had been
expelled from school came in and Debolt looked up and said, &ldquo;What
are you doing here? I thought I told you to stay home..&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The kid said, &ldquo;My dad told me to come back.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The principal said, &ldquo;You tell him I told you
to go home.&rdquo; As the kid just stood there he said, &ldquo;Get
out or I will throw you out.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The kid said, &ldquo;You aren&rsquo;t big enough.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The principal started after him but before <I>the
principal </I>reached the office door I heard the front door of the
school slam. The kid wasted no time. The principal finally got calmed
down enough to write my excuse and I went to class.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I found <I>out </I>a little while later that the
boy&rsquo;s father came into the office and started giving Debolt a
hard time. He told the man to step into his office and they would
discuss it there. When they went in, the principal locked the door
behind him and beat the father up and put him in the hospital.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Later on three of the father&rsquo;s friends came
in and tried to beat up the principal but the worse that they could
do was give him two black eyes. <I>However, </I>they made it so hot
for him that the school board let him go. That didn&rsquo;t hurt our
feelings any.</P>

<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">About this time dad was looking for some tires for
the car and a tire man on the east side of town had an Elgin car that
he said he would sell him the tires or the whole car for twenty-seven
dollars. So, I talked dad into getting the whole car so that I could
have the engine to make me a bug out of, as we called them those
days.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I bought an old Ford chassis from a place on my
paper route <I>which</I> I put the Elgin engine and transmission in.
I finally got it running but I got the center of gravity to high and
it didn&rsquo;t have brakes that would stop it to quickly. So It was
some outfit but it was all mine.. Oh yes, it had one other bad habit,
it would jack knife it you tried to turn a corner too fast which
caused me some trouble at times. I spent all the money I made on it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I wasn&rsquo;t doing too well at school, not
because I couldn&rsquo;t but because I had lost interest. I talked
the folks into letting me quit which I would later regret.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Before getting into that, I went to work for a
Negro tailor after school on Saturdays. I had quite the experiences
there and got to understand the Negroes quite well both bad and good.
Lee, which was his name, was real good to me and we got along just
fine together. I learned. quite a bit about tailoring and the
cleaning business and met some interesting people.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The man that owned the auditorium was putting on a
movie and he hired me along with two other fellows to pass out hand
bills around town. We spent two days going all over town putting
these bills on the porches and I was figuring on what all I was going
to do with my pay.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When I went to Mr. Gatheand I told him I had
gotten rid of all my hand bills. He turned to his secretary and said,
&ldquo;Give this boy a pass to the show.&rdquo; Two days work for a
thirty-five cent ticket to a crummy movie, that wasn&rsquo;t even
interesting. That was the last time I did anything for him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We used to go see the Tailor players at the

<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">After I quit school, I got a job working on a
ranch in Inkom in the winter. I had never been on a ranch before and
they had a little shack for the hired man to stay in. The little
stove in it didn&rsquo;t work very good and before I quit and went
home I had frozen the toes on both my feet. They all pealed off and
from then on they were the first thing to get cold. The rest of my
feet can be warm and they will be cold.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">In the summer I got a job with the Hubbard ranch
on trail creek and there I got my first lessons in handling horses.
At first I was scared to death of them until I got broke in and then
we got along</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">fine. We started out hauling in grain that had
been cut while green for hay. Then we had to get up at four in the
morning and go to the barn, harness the horses and feed them. I had a
string of six to take care of as we were using twenty two of them on
the grain combine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The combine was a twenty two foot cut Holt. The
separator <I>on it</I> was run by an engine but it was pulled by
horses. We had. some steep hills to pull it around.</P>

for me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The next spring dad lined me up with a Mr. Johnson
from Arco for a summer job. I decided to drive my bug up to Arco. I
had to borrow ten dollars from Mr. Ross to get there. I took off in
the morning for his place and as I left Moreland I hit a bump and
unknown to me my tools fell out of my outfit. (It was a gravel road
from there to within five miles of Arco.)</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I got the other side of a place called Taber and I
fell into a hole that was once a mud hole. It was filled with fine
dirt that had no bottom to it. After a while, a man came along with a
Chevrolet and hooked on to me and pulled me out. He went a short
distance and broke his axle so I hooked on to him and started to pull
him but my car started boiling on me. He told me to unhook from him
and he caught a ride into town where he got the wrecker from the
garage where he worked and came back for it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I kept plugging away at it until I got to Arco. It
was so late that I got a room in the hotel which cost me a dollar.

me some breakfast and I felt a lot better after that.</P>

we were working with. As soon as dinner was over with, he would want
me to turn the sickle grinder for him so he could sharpen his sickle.
He would grind and grind on it far more than he needed to and it
would take up my entire noon hour and sometimes longer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When we went over to his place to work, the field

eating beans and that was it. I was <I>kind of </I>glad when that job
was over.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">After the hay was up, we took a team and the
running gear of the wagon and went into the hills and got out a load
of poles.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I spent my whole summers wages on that old car of
mine and was still having troubles. I went up to Darlington one
evening to get a pair of shoes at the store. On the way back I came
home in the dark. My lights weren't to good and I came to a sharp
corner before I realized it. I had to make a quick turn and as usual
it jack-knifed on me. I turned it the other way to get out of trouble
<I>and when it did it </I>lit in the bottom of a hole beside the road
but I got out of that and made it back to the ranch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">That fall I picked spuds for one of the neighbors
and after that got word from my father that he had a job for me at
Thompson's Tire Shop and so I went up to the man's place to get my
pay for picking spuds. He said he would go into the bank and get my
money for me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I took off down the road ahead of him <I>but I was</I>
going to another place to collect <I>first. When </I>I came to the
corner, I turned it going too fast. The door flew open and threw me
out. I jumped up and started chasing my car down the road. It went a
ways <I>before</I> taking off into the ditch <I>where</I> the front
wheels went up into the air and came down on top of a fence <I>where
it finally</I> stopped.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I was about a mile from the ranch so I walked back
and got some fencing tools, took the fence down <I>so</I> <I>I could
</I>back the car up on the road. <I>After</I> <I>putting</I> the
fence back <I>up </I>again, <I>I </I>drove back to the ranch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Mr Johnson said he saw Mr Jensen in town and asked
him if I <I>had </I>drowned.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in"><I>Mr Jensen </I>said, &ldquo;No, well I was
following him down the road and all of a sudden there he was chasing
his car down the road.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Well I went back to Darlington store as the lady
there had told me that I could have one of their dog's pups to take
home to my sister Opal.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in">The next day I took off
for home but I didn&rsquo;t get started to early. The radiator leaked
<I>so that </I>I had a lot of trouble on the way. When I got to Taber
it was getting dark and I stopped at the railroad section house <I>where</I>
they told me I could stay there that night and get an early start <I>the</I>
next morning. During the night the damn pup would get out from under
the covers and bark at every movement. I would grab him and stuff him
back under the covers to shut him up. The next morning I got up an
took off for home getting there just before noon. I found out that
they had the sheriff out looking for me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I came home to a new location <I>because</I> the
lumber yard across the alley from where we lived on Arthur street had
burned and <I>the fire </I>burned the side of <I>our</I> house so <I>my</I>
folks sold the place to the people in front and moved to the other
side off town.</P>

HOME ONCE MORE</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When I got home my sister Viola was going to
college. She had met a girl and they became great friends and her
brother was in Pocatello working at Nabisco warehouse. She was
Lillian Rhinehart and he was Walter Rhinehart. Walter and I got to be
good friends and we got to taking the two girls out to shows each
week and took turns paying for the show and the treat after. We had a
lot of fun going places.</P>
<p style="text-indent: 0.2in"><font face="Arial">My sister got a job teaching school. She bought a car, a
Chrysler coupe and. we went a lot of places in it. One time we
started to go up to Dietrick to their folks place and we got below
American Falls when the distributor gear went out on it. We had to
call dad and have him come tow us back home and then took his car and
finished the trip. Coming back the generator went out in it so all in
all it wasn&rsquo;t too successful a trip but we made it. </font></p>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">My sister had a girl friend named Mildred Selders
and she went to a church, a split from the Nazerine church and they
had a little, short fat minister and for some reason my sister seemed
to enjoy antagonizing him. She wanted to go to their young peoples
meeting one Sunday before we went to the show. After the meeting we
got up to leave and the minister was at the door. He said he would
like to have us stay for church services as he had prepared a nice
sermon. Viola said no that we were taking them to the show and he
turned to Walter and I and said, &ldquo;Young men, you are leading
these ladies in the paths of sin&rdquo;. Lillian, who was fast to
come up with an answer for most any occasion said, &rdquo;Don&rsquo;t
worry, they are paying for it tonight.&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t the
right thing to do but it is one of those things that you do that you
live to realize it wasn&rsquo;t the right thing to do but that is
where the live and. learn part comes in I guess.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The next spring the depression caught up with us.
Walter got laid. off and went back home to help his father on the
ranch. I got laid off and was out of a job. I took up with George
Bertwell, the man that Mildred Selders married, and we fooled around
<I>together</I>. He had a job on the railroad but he only got to work
five days a month. He bought a house that was vacant and we tore it
down so he could. build a garage back of his house. I was with him
once when he went into the butcher shop and bought half a hog for
five dollars. He was keeping his mother, sister and her husband that
was crippled with arthritis, and their small daughter and his wife.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I used to write a paper and send it to the
Rhineharts as Viola was visiting them also.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I got a job on the state highway through Governor
Ross who was a good. friend of ours and that winter we had a lot of
snow. It piled up on the highway especially between Lava and the
Wyoming line.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I and another fellow were sent up there to help
clear the road with our snow plow. When we left Lava we ran into
heavy going and when we were about four miles from Bancroft, we came
to an old car that was staled in the middle of the road. We pulled it
back and made a place for us to go around it but we misjudged the
edge of the road, slid into the bar pit and got stuck.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">It was late at night and my partner <I>asked</I>,
&ldquo;Shall we get out and shovel out or shall we sit tight and wait
for daylight?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in">I said it didn&rsquo;t
make any difference to me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in">So, he said, &ldquo;We
will wait for daylight&rdquo; as we had plenty of gas with us and a
good heater. So we waited &lsquo;til it got light.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">We
got out and looked the situation over and found out that the crew
from Soda Springs had quit about two hundred feet from where we were
the night before. So we got busy and started shoveling our way out.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When they showed up on the scene, we got the road
open and headed on up to Bancroft. While we were there a man came
struggling down a hill from a shack and got the old car started. He
said that he had been there for three days waiting for us to show up.
He could of gotten on the railroad track and walked to Bancroft as
the rail was high and dry but he was a bootlegger and he was afraid
to leave the keg of stuff he had buried in the snow.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The weather wasn&rsquo;t awfully cold that winter.
In fact, it would get warm enough in the day to settle the snow,
which made it very difficult for the snow plows as the snow would
pack in front of the plow instead of blowing away from it when we hit
it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">So when we got to Bancroft we found that the snow
was about six feet deep from there on and settled all the way. So,
they double headed with one plow and then hired thirty farmers to
break the crust snow into big chunks. Then they would get out of the
way and the plow would take a run at it and throw it out and then the
farmers would knock some more down and so on.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I got tired of sitting in the truck as the other
fellow was doing the driving so I would get out and shovel too. They
went fourteen miles that way before they got the road open we stayed
and widened the road with a small rotary plow that we had.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We were on the night shift and I was sitting on
the right side when I saw the wing of the plow cut through a keg. I
told my partner and he stopped and we got out and dug three more out
of the snow. But they were all empty. We threw them in the back and
we hadn&rsquo;t gone very far before we heard a honking. A Greek came
up to us and said I see you found my kegs and we said yes and if they
was full, you would have a hard time getting them back. He laughed
and said he had buried them during the storm and then couldn&rsquo;t
find them again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">About an hour later our outfit quit going. The
engine would run but we couldn&rsquo;t go anyplace. We found out that
we had broke a universal joint in one of the driving axles so we got
some old tires we had laying in the bed of the truck and built a fire
in back of the truck. My partner caught a ride into Bancroft and
called Pocatello. They said they would send out a new part for us <I>and</I>
to start removing it. Well <I>we</I> got our tools out and went to
work. My pal said, &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have to worry about putting
it back. They will bring a mechanic with them to do that.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Well they got there but it was two of the big wigs
who didn&rsquo;t approve of the place we had our fire. <I>They</I>
handed us the parts an got back in their car and headed back home. I
said, &ldquo;I thought you said they was bringing a mechanic with
them.&rdquo; He just said something I won&rsquo;t repeat here. We got
busy and finished the job ourselves. We went back to our own district
and that spring as I was single, they laid me off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Well Viola was at Rhineharts farm at Dietrich and
they invited me up too so I took off for the farm. I was going to
stay for a few days but when I got there</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Walter and his father had gotten a contract for
unloading and hauling coal for the Shoshone schools. So, I went with
them and helped them unload it by hand. We</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Hauled it to the school and unloaded it off their
model T truck with scoops.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">After that was over, Mr. Rhinehart said you
haven&rsquo;t got anything to do at home stay here with us and help
us. So I stayed there and when thrashing time came around I went with
Walter and he asked if I could help. They said they would be glad to
have me but they couldn&rsquo;t pay me anything except my dinner. I
told them that it would be fine so I went through the season working
for my dinner. The women used to really spread it on for the
thrashing crews and we used to have quite the time in the field.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I remember one time a fellow came to thrash for
the tract and his separator was in poor shape. The spike pitchers in
the field would carry a deck of cards with them. They would tell us
fellows, <I>who were</I> hauling bundles, to fix the machine as they
needed a rest. So, we would throw in two bundles at once <I>while</I>
the fellow on the other side of the feeder would throw one in
crosswise. The machine would plug up and every belt on it would fly
off. He would have to crawl inside and dig out the grain, <I>which</I>
would take him about an hour and he still had to put all the belts
back on. He took it for so long and then he complained to the farmers
and they told <I>us</I> we had better quit it so we did. But I
figured he was asking for it when he came on the tract with a worn
out machine.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The Millerner Shoshane canal went through their
place and we would go for a swim at night to wash the dust off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The next summer I went back and got jobs working
for a dollar a day and my board. I helped in the haying and other
chores. That summer the farmers seemed to have time on their hands
between crops and they got in the habit of taking their cars down the
ditch banks and pulling one of their friends on a surfboard that they
made that had a long rope tied to it. They got a lot of fun out of
surfing on the water in the ditch.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">There was quite a few bachelors on the tract that
homesteaded the land when the tract was first opened up. I thought
that most of them was sort of on the queer side. One of them, a
fellow named Emmit Young wanted me to come work for him so I did but
after three days I told him I had other things I had to do. He
wouldn&rsquo;t let me do anything unless I did it exactly like <I>he</I>
would do it. When I didn&rsquo;t, he would come and show me how I
wasn&rsquo;t much use to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">This same man had to go to the vets hospital at
Boise to have a minor operation and he wanted Walter to come and stay
at his place while he was gone. Walter said he would if I could go
with him. We went to his place and at night we had to unlock two
doors to get to the bedroom. When Walter laid back on the pillow, he
banged his head on something. He reached under the pillow and pulled
out a big 45 automatic revolver. We said that we wouldn&rsquo;t want
to be prowling around there at night.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I made up my mind that if I were ever to take up
farming, It wouldn&rsquo;t be as a bachelor.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">We
used to go out and see the ice caves and this was long before they
commercialized it when you had to climb down ladders and under a low
overhang to get to the main chamber.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Mrs. Rhinehart and her sister Bertha, who lived
with them, made their own cheese and put up all their vegetables and
fruit. Mr. Rhinehart would get a dime western and go sit down and
read and have the butter churning in his lap at the same time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Walter had a younger brother named Oscar who was a
good kid for he had to be as much as he got kidded and picked on.
When it came milking time, his father would get after him for taking
so long to milk his cow. He asked him what he was doing and he said
he was counting the number of squirts it took to milk his cow but the
truth of the matter <I>was that </I>he knew the longer he took the
fewer cows he would have to milk.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">They tried to get Lillian to help them so finally
she went out to the barn and with her long fingernails she had no
trouble in getting all the cows to kicking. So, they told her she
could go to the house and she wasn&rsquo;t bothered any more. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The women didn&rsquo;t cooperate too good with us
when it came to helping with the farming. We were putting up hay and
Walter&rsquo;s father was in town so he finally talked his mother
into coming out and driving derrick horse for us, much against her
will. She started the horse out and didn&rsquo;t stop him until he
had pulled</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">the jackson fork to the top of the pole, locked it
into the pulley and the cable run through. We had to let the pole
down and fix it so she got excused. We always thought that she did it
on purpose, which was true.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We went over to Townson&rsquo;s place to help them
hay and she would cook an enormous meal for us and then get insulted
if we didn&rsquo;t eat more than we could hold but we just couldn&rsquo;t
manage all of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">He (Mr. Townson) was a brother to Mrs. Rhinehart
and a chicken farmer with several thousand chickens for laying. One
of his boys had a big sheep dog and he and his dog would go out in
the field <I>hunting mice. </I>When he saw a mouse hole he would get
the dog to dig them out and if they were in good shape when he got
them, he would put them in his pocket and pack them around with him.</P>

YOWELL EXPERIENCE</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I also worked for some people by the name of
Yowells and also for their son at Besslem on the edge of the tract.
One year it was very dry and there wasn&rsquo;t any grass out in the
desert so the jackrabbits <I>would</I> came into the fields and eat
the grain and hay.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">They organized rabbit drives <I>where</I> we would
go out in the sage brush surrounding the tract and start walking
toward a farm that had a woven wire fence around it. They would have
a wire enclosure built at one end and we would drive them into it
where they would kill them. We would get 3000 or so of them in one
drive.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">They got to taking the spokes out of old wagon
wheels and carrying them with them to throw at the rabbits as we were
driving them. When you threw one you didn&rsquo;t want to run ahead
to pick it up again because you were liable to get hit by one. So you
waited until the line walked up to it and then you picked it up. We
even had the newsreel out taking pictures of it one night. We also
had people back east saying we were inhuman and got quite a bit of
notoriety out of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I also worked for a fellow named Claire Watson
stacking hay for him he was a man that didn&rsquo;t stop work for
anything very seldom went to town and holidays and</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">Sundays
were just another day to him. So one fourth of July the Rhineharts
came and told me that they were going up the Salmon River.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">River
and wanted to know if I didn&rsquo;t want to go along. So I told
Claire that I would like to go <I>and asked if he </I>going to take
the fourth off. He said he would sure like to get his hay put up so I
said I would stay and help. I was doing the stacking and her brother
and family came out and brought ice cream and other stuff with them
for dinner so I filled up on that kind of stuff. When we went out to
hay I was on the stack for a awhile when I began to feel funny and
dizzy. Things went black and I slid off the end of the stack and laid
in the shade for awhile. It turned out that I <I>had</I> had a case
of sunstroke.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Well, that fall old man Yowell heard of a place
called New Bieber in northern California where some Yowells lived. He
wanted to go there and see if they were any relation and they, he and
his son Cassius and a man we knew in Dietrich named Ted Whitmyer,
wanted me to go with them so I decided to go.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Yowell had a model A Ford sedan that we had just
overhauled. We started out bright and early one morning on September
25th 1933 and headed for the Idaho Oregon border. We went through
Boise but didn&rsquo;t stop long; <I>then</I> on to Caldwell, Nampa
and the state line <I>and then</I> on to Ontario where we stopped and
registered our car. We drove out of town a ways and had dinner and
then on to Burns. We sure ran into some road. It was just a trail you
might say over the mountain range as they were building a new road.
We just had to hop around in the sagebrush the best we could but we
made it into Burns alright and rented a cabin for the night.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">It was raining when we got there and it cost us a
dollar as I recall. Of course it contained a small wood stove at one
corner and an iron bed at the other complete with a mattress, such as
it was, but in those days when you rented a cabin a cabin you got.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We had supper and Ted baked some apples that he
swiped while we were in Idaho. They turned out to <I>be too</I> green
to eat. Cash made some gravy out of pancake flour as that was the
only flour we had with us and it wasn&rsquo;t bad. I fried potatoes
and Cash fried some mutton and we thought it was a good dinner.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We were minus a pinochle deck after dinner so we
matched to see who would go and get one and that was me so I took a
hike up town and got one. We quit playing at 11 o&rsquo;clock and
went to bed Tuesday.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We left Burns and went on to Wagontire passing
several dry lake beds on the way. We reached the state line where we
were stopped by the quarantine officer who went through our outfit to
make sure we didn&rsquo;t have any fruit with us. He told us of a
good place to stop and eat just seven miles in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We stopped there among some big pine trees and
then we drove on to Lakeview where we saw all kinds of trucks hauling
logs to three big saw mills in town. We then went on to New Bieber,
our destination and looked over the country. It didn&rsquo;t impress
us to much but decided to look it over anyway. We looked up the
Yowells that lived in that county and found them at Adin about ten
miles from New Bieber. We stayed with them that night <I>but</I> the
rest of the time we stayed at the JE Yowell place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We got up and had deer meat for breakfast and JE
took us down to see a field on his ranch and he also had a school bus
route. His ranch was 480 acres big with a water right to three
springs that went through the place. He said that he paid six
thousand dollars for it. Boy what a difference today.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We drove back to the house and got on our rig and
drove around looking the country over. We came back and JE took old
man Yowell and Cash on his bus route with him while JE&rsquo;s son
Floyd, Ted and I played pinochle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in"><I>The</I> next day we got in the car and went out
to look over some more of the country. We went by lookout Bieber
where we got some meat for our dinner and as I recall it the
hamburger was selling for fifteen cents a pound. We went to the top
of the hill where we could see Fall River Valley to eat but there
wasn&rsquo;t any water there so went back to New Bieber an ate our
lunch. We took in some more country and back to Adin and some more
pinochle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Next morning we helped with the chores and played
pinochle till noon and after dinner we went to see the school rodeo
on a man&rsquo;s place that had a bunch of calves to ride and a pig
to catch. The calf threw kid&laquo; right and left and when one of
the school teachers tried it, he got thrown on his neck without any
harm to the ground where he lit. One kid was sitting on his lunch box
inside the corral by the fence watching the performance and one calf
came charging at him and let out a snort and he just naturally
disappeared. After the rodeo we went home and played pinochle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Next day we went out to look over a place the old
man Yowell and Cash thought they might try to rent. We inspected
every thing on the place and found out that he had peacocks on the
place; the first ones I had ever seen. We came home and Ted and I
hiked to the top of the hill by the place and got some big pine cones
and came back. I played cards with the two senior Yowells while Cash,
Ted, Floyd and his sister went to the dance at Lookout.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Next day Floyd, JE, Ted and I went deer hunting
and we drove up Barber canyon a short distance from their place and
then the fun began as we had to go through tall underbrush. Finally,
on top of a hill, we saw four deer but no bucks. So we went on
without seeing any more deer till we came to the top of the third
hill where we saw a mule deer buck and JE shot it. We tracked it to
where it fell and the others cleaned it while I went and got the car.
We loaded it in, went home and skinning it took up the rest of the
day.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Monday we decided to go to Malin, Oregon to see
the country and we drove by way of Lookout through a forest and into
Oregon. Saw all we wanted of that country and headed back. Stopped
and had dinner and went back by way of Camby. Wound up the day as
usual playing pinochle.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Next day we fooled around most of the day and Ted
and I went on bus route with JE and took in some more country. Next
we went to see the owner of the farm where the peacocks were and JE
treated us to some 3.2 beer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">Next
day we said goodbye to the JE Yowells and headed for home by way of
Reno. Drove over mountains through Souzanville California and across
line to Reno. Drove around a bit and headed out across country
passing a soda bed on the way. We stopped that night at Lovelock.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We was walking down the street and I went to step
off the curb and I fell a lot farther than we do here their curbs
were really high. Next day we pulled into Elko and got some stuff to
eat on the way; then to Twin Falls and on to Dietrich. The reason I
am able to give such a detailed account of the trip is because I kept
a diary of it and sent it to Viola. She kept it and put it along with
some pictures in one of her photo albums and I ran across it <I>again</I>
with some stuff mother had.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I stayed with the Cash Yowells one winter and
worked for my board and room. I slept upstairs with their boys and it
was never finished, just the studding a window at each end that was
broke out, but we were comfortable and we never had a cold all winter
long.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">After the crops were all in, they started having
Saturday night dances at the Grange hall and I decided to learn how
to dance but gave it up as the girls didn&rsquo;t want to dance with
you unless you were half shot. I wasn&rsquo;t going to do that so I
told them that I was going into Shoshone to the show so Cash said
fine, come back and pick us up when it is over.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I got back at midnight and the dance was still
going on. I was wondering if it was going to wind up in a fight, like
it did every once in while. It finally broke up gracefully at two.
They came out and Cash said they were going over to Bus Pattersons
for a party but I said it&rsquo;s past midnight let&rsquo;s go home.
So, we had to go there so we went there and Bus went in his cellar
and brought a whole armload of home brew that tasted terrible. I
wouldn&rsquo;t drink any of it but Cash, who had already had a lot
more booze than he needed, drank seven bottles of it one after
another. We finally got home at five decided to do the chores before
we went to bed. After we got to bed, Cash went outside and heaved for
a long time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">For the next three days he acted like he was going
to drop dead any time but by the time next Saturday rolled around he
was ready to go again. It should have cured him but it didn&rsquo;t.
It was to cost him his family, his farm and break up another family
before he quit.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">He had a neighbor, Bill Nelson and he sent me over
to help him put up his grain as he headed and stacked it. He had a
couple of fellows hired to do chores as he had a string of cows to
milk and take care of. They got mad at him and quit and he went to
town and when it came time to do chores, no one was there to do them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">His wife asked me if I wouldn&rsquo;t start the
chores for her till she could get me some help so I started milking
and I got all the cows milked and was pouring the  milk in the
separator when Bill finally showed up and he had a bottle of beer in
his hand and said here Ralph here, drink this and I will finish after
milking those cows by hand on a hot August day it didn&rsquo;t taste
too bad he had went to town and got to drinking and forgot what time
it was.</P>

FOR THE CHURCHES</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The next summer I went to work for a man named
Sherman Church who was a bean farmer. He had a wife that talked
continually. How she could think of that many things to talk about I
never could <FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">quite
figure out but I worked that summer for him. I learned a little bit
about bean farming. He had a Ford truck that he hauled grain for the
farmers at harvest time and I drove it part time for him and had
quite the experiences there.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I almost lost the truck and grain both in a canal.
The bridge had a broken stringer in it and I didn&rsquo;t know it.
The other fellow that was hauling had broken it and never told anyone
about it, including me, until I told him about it. On the next load,
luck for me, I had enough momentum up that it carried me across,
after throwing me around a bit. Then we had to drive onto a platform
and put the front wheels up on top of a high rise so the grain would
slide out. We didn&rsquo;t have any hoists on the farm trucks them
days. This was at a siding in Dietrich where they unloaded it to be
shipped to the Gooding mill and elevator.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I remember two years before the government had
given the farmers seed loans to plant crops with and some of them
spent it for other things. It was sent to them direct and that fall
the President declared a moratorium on it so the farmers wouldn&rsquo;t
have to pay it back that fall. The farmers got the impression that
they weren&rsquo;t going to have to pay it back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">They were quite shocked when they found that their
check had the government man&rsquo;s name on the check along with
theirs. The check had to be sent to a bank in Portland to be cashed
where what was owed was withheld and the rest sent back to the
farmers. Sometimes it took three months.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The boss was hauling grain at a bachelor&rsquo;s
place and he had a big crop. The crew told him that he had to buy
them an eight-gallon keg of beer to celebrate on and he said they
would have to furnish half of it and he would furnish the other half.
So, they did and about seven the boss came and wanted to know if I
wanted a drink of beer and I said yes so we went down to the place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">There were still two men there. One was an elderly
man who&rsquo;s wife never very often trusted him out of her site and
he had already had too much. They wanted me to drink with them but
when I took a drink, I said no more. It had been sitting around since
noon and as far as I was concerned it wasn&rsquo;t fit to drink but
those two stayed until it was all gone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Then the old fellow got on his wagon and told his
team to get up and fell over backwards on his rack and passed out.
His horses went on home, turned into the barnyard and stopped. His
wife went out to see why it was taking him so long to put the team
away and he didn&rsquo;t get to leave home for quite some time after
that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">One fall one of the neighbors wanted me to help
put up hay and they used an overshot and buck rakes which I had never
had any experience with before. They told me I could run one of the
buck rakes. They gave me a big black team and I hitched them up to
the rake and I had two gates to go through right at the start.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">You
sat on one of these things with steering peddles for each foot to
steer with. The horses did most of the steering, if you knew how to
steer them right. But every time I tried to steer them through the
gate, I would wind up on the gate post. I was getting pretty shook up
when I remembered hearing one of the men saying that the team had
been on the buck rake for a long time. So I backed them up and
dropped the lines and said get up and they went through both gates
with no trouble. When we got in the field I let the horses do the
steering and we never had any trouble.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">My fondest memories were of the Rhineharts and the
great times I had. But in the fall, when I quit working for Church, I
went home with $120 of my summers wage. Viola and I went shopping for
a clothes washer for mother to replace the one that was falling
apart. We were going to keep it for Xmas that wasn't far off but when
the next door neighbor teased about it she said, &ldquo;You give it
to her now. I can hear that old one for blocks away when she uses
it.&rdquo; So we had them bring it out to the next time she was to
wash.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The next summer Mr Johnson at Arco had moved to
Mackay and wanted me to come up there so I went there as I had
nothing else to do. While I was there he had lost a horse  and he
said that he would give me five dollars if I would go and find it. He
gave me old Roudy, a horse he had had for a long   time, to ride.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I went out wandering around bare back and wound up
below Moreland at Ralph Babcocks place. I knew him from the time
before and he had me into dinner. When I got ready to go he loaned me
a saddle to use and said he would pick it up next time he went to
Mackay so I started back. It was getting late and I was getting sore
so I would get off and walk for awhile before getting back on. Poor
old Roudy was getting tired also so when I would get back on he would
go for a ways and then stop and look back at me as though to say,
&ldquo;Aren't you going to get off?&rdquo; So I finally got off and
walked the rest of the way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">After we got home he laid around for a couple of
days resting up poor fellow. I didn't realize we were so far from
home. When I finally did find the horse, I wondered why he wanted
him. He wasn't worth two cents, the ornery old sway backed critter
anyway.</P>

UP WITH THE GOVERNOR</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Then I went home and the Rosses, he was then
governor of the state, said if I came up to Boise they would find me
a job. So dad got me a ride with a convoy driving some Terra planes
to Oregon and I met them at the old Keystone hotel and rode up with
them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I stayed at the Ross place and Mrs Ross had me
driving car for her and taking her to their ranch at Parma. She
finally asked me if I wanted Ben to get me a political job or a job
on their ranch so I chose the job on the ranch because I had had all
the political jobs I wanted. I knew what I could get would be hard to
hold on to and wouldn't be all that good.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">In one of their ranch houses they had rented out,
they had a room for Ben to stay when he came out to the ranch and
they let me stay there. The people that rented the place was Sparks.
They had two sons and two daughters and were awfully nice people. I
boarded with them for awhile and they were members of the Baptist
church which was not far from their place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">They wanted me to go with them one Sunday so I
went and one of the girls sitting back of us in Sunday school class
took a liking to me but we couldn't seem to get together, mostly due
to my dumbness and just not knowing how to act seriously around a
girl. She liked to go to dances and the like where I was completely
lost but she was a wonderful girl. She and her two sisters sang at
different places and meetings. She and her folks moved to Oregon
where she died a year later of lung complications.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in"><FONT COLOR="#000000">It was the year of elections
and one Sunday the Sunday school teacher asked the people of the
class how they were going to vote. Most of them gave various answers
without committing themselves which should have told me something. It
didn&rsquo;t and when she came to me I said Roosevelt and that was
the wrong answer. She was a Republican and when Sunday school was
over, she cornered me in the hall and told me all about the error of
my decision and kept me there for the rest of the meeting. When <FONT SIZE=3>we
got outside Sparks said, &ldquo;I wanted to tell you about her but
there was no way,&rdquo; and said, &ldquo;live and learn.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">This woman was a widow and she had a niece staying
with her for the summer. We were invited to their place for a
birthday party for her niece. They had goat&rsquo;s milk as this
woman was a strong believer of goat&rsquo;s milk and had several. I
thought it was good, which it was, and we had a good time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">While I was there my sister Viola had been back to
Kansas and she and our cousin Evelyn decided to go on a harvest train
working across country in the harvest. They came out that way to work
in the raspberries north of Boise. It was during the haying season
and one morning at four in the morning the phone rang. It was my
sister wanting to know if I wouldn't come to Caldwell and get them.
So I took off.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I had fifty miles to go and I had to be careful.
The car I had had a habit of throwing a rod if you drove over fifty.
The place that fixed it before I got it was supposed to take care of
it but they had never found what caused it. I got there and found out
that they had stayed at the depot since 10 o'clock the night before.
They were afraid I would be in bed and they would wake me. I said,
&ldquo;What do you think you did this morning. Besides I would have
had time to come get you then.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Anyway we made it back to the ranch with a rod
gone because I started crowding it in order to make it back in time
to get the haying crew started. I was supposed to stack but I was
about fifteen minutes late. The boss wasn't around to see it so it
was all right. They stayed for a few days and then went up to get
jobs picking berries. Finally they wound up in Washington picking
apples.<BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="page-break-before: always; text-indent:0.2in">I was in Parma
getting a haircut one Saturday when I came out to get in my car, a
woman was standing beside it. She was staying with the neighbor down
the street so I spoke to her. We got to talking and I took her to the
show at Caldwell but the show wasn't what she was interested in. I
was still afraid of what she was interested in and anyway she was on
vacation from     her husband. I didn't want to get involved because
she was supposed to be   getting a divorce. I was still afraid so for
her the evening was a flop.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We had a big bay horse on the ranch that loved to
run and he knew when he could and when he couldn't. There wasn't
anyone working on the ranch that was what you would call a horseman.
Thus, we had a few runs on the ranch. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I was hauling a load of hay out of the field one
day. As I was coming down a small hill, one of the tugs came unhooked
on the run away. I tried to stop them before they started to pull
again and the bay horse surprised me when I was off balance and it
threw me off. I lit against my right arm and skidded on my face. I
went into the doctor and he cleaned me up. I thought I was all right
but the next morning my arm had swollen at the elbow and it was
hurting so I went back to the doctor and he sent me to Caldwell for
an X-ray. They found out that I had broken the small bone in my arm
so they put it in a cast.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Ben decided to put in a tile drain of better than
two thousand feet through his place and he got a tile form. Mr.
Spark&rsquo;s neighbor and I started making tile in the spud cellar.
He had hired a bunch of characters that had come out from West Planes
Missouri to dig the ditch and lay the pipe. After working with them,
I would believe all of those tales they tell about the backwoodsmen.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in"><FONT SIZE=3>We had them when we were putting up
hay and they had never seen a Jackson fork before. We had quite a
time because they wouldn&rsquo;t pay any attention to what you told
them. </FONT><FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">One
of them, called Charlie, had the habit of letting the trip rope coil
around his feet. I told him that he was going to get hung up but he
didn&rsquo;t pay any attention and sure enough I hear him holler and
looked around to see him hanging in the air by the trip rope. As soon
as we could get the derrick team backed up we got him untangled. It
sort of made him a little more cautious after that.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I was never so tired of putting up hay in all my
life. It took twice as long as it should.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Mrs. Ross brought out a hundred day-old chicks for
me to take care of and I had good luck with them. But they were
always giving dinners for someone and they would come out to the
ranch and get two or three of them at a time. They wanted us to clean
them for them. Finally they came out to get several and there was
only one left. She had a fit saying that someone there was taking her
chickens which they weren&rsquo;t it was they who had taken them. She
seemed to think that they would last as long as she desired I guess.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Ben and his neighbor bought a man&rsquo;s geese
and they were going to divide them up and each and each one was going
to have three ganders and three geese. His neighbor said he could
tell them apart so he would divide them. We wound up with one gander
and five hens and he had one hen and five ganders. We raised six
little ones and when they were grown Ben came out to the ranch about
noon one day and said, &ldquo;Ralph, I want you to kill a couple of
them geese and clean them for me.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="text-indent: 0.2in">Boy if you ever tried to
clean a goose in a hurry you will appreciate the job I had. When he
got ready to go I had one of them about done and he was in a hurry so
I gave them to him and let the women down there finish. I figured
that if they wanted them bad enough they could finish them. I didn&rsquo;t
have troubles enough, they had to bring out a Llewellin Setter that
some character had given them and I didn&rsquo;t do to bad with him
until they brought out a female pointer and that did it, I lost both
of them.</P>

and Ben was taking him around the country and showing him some of the
farmland. The cavalcade came down the highway as I was cleaning the
culvert under the highway and getting the water to run through it for
the first time. I stopped and waved at him and he waved back with a
big grin on his face.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Ben decided to go into the hog raising business
which would have been alright but he went in with a big bang and was
going to be the biggest hog raiser in the</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">state. Boy what a mess we had. He wouldn&rsquo;t
listen to any of the locals. He went strictly by what the university
told him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">They had never been down to look over his layout
or anything. We had a hundred head of brood sows that we weren&rsquo;t
equipped to handle and he wanted us to chop up hay and mix it three
fourths hay and one fourth grain to feed to his brood sows. We tried
to tell him that it wouldn&rsquo;t produce pigs but we didn&rsquo;t
know anything according to him.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">So we wound up with three and four pigs to the
litter and we couldn&rsquo;t fatten them out for market to make any
money. We finally talked him into letting us slop feed them brood
sows but it was a case of two little to late and he quit the hogs.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in"><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif">We started
combing grain and Jesse Lowe, a man working there and I was doing it.
He ran the combine while I hauled the grain in the wagon. Ben wanted
to get in all the time at it we could so he said that he would pay us
extra if we would work through noon hour.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">So I would run the combine while Jesse ate his
lunch and he would take care of things while I ate and that way we
kept going.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">But one noon I was standing in front of the team
letting them eat oats while I was waiting for the machine to fill the
hopper so it could come and unload it in the wagon. <I>I was </I>not
watching my runaway like I should <I>because</I> there wasn&rsquo;t a
thing to scare him. But he all of a sudden lifted his head and
sniffed the air and I reached up and took hold of his bridal and told
him to stand still. He lurched forward and I grabbed hold of the
other horses bridal to keep from getting trampled on and across the
field we went. Thank goodness it was only a ten-acre field but that
<I>is still</I> a long ways when you are being dragged between two
horses on a dead run.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">He had a habit of going straight for a fence and
stopping to see which way the barn was and then trying to break loose
and trot off to it. So I was going to hang on until we got there,
drop down and pull myself under the fence and let them have it. But
just as we got there, the machine came around the corner of the field
and they made a wide swing, dropped me on the ground and run over me
with the wagon.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Well you have seen the western where the hero
saves the stage by dropping between the horses and letting the coach

me.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">They gathered me up, and took me to the Drs in

<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">So I wound up there for the second time. The first
time was when my broken arm didn&rsquo;t heal properly and I couldn&rsquo;t
straighten it out. That was the first time I had been in one. <I>This

down in bed so I couldn&rsquo;t roll over and wreck the cast before
it had a chance to set. Boy did I put in a miserable night. I thought
my back was going to finish breaking in two. But after that I decided
to come home and go back in three months, which was when they said to
come back.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">So I got introduced to photography by George
Bertwell, who was into it and I developed my own pictures as well. It
gave me something to do. He and I compared notes but he was a lot

<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When he tackled anything he went into it studying
up on all he aspects of it and would tell you of things that the

more that way.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I went back to Caldwell to get my cast removed and
found out that my back hadn&rsquo;t healed altogether so back in the
cast for another three months and back home again. They put me in a
brace after that but at least I could take it off when I was tired.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in"><FONT SIZE=3>I went back up to the state doctors

and so then I came home and enrolled under state aid.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I put in six months there which was the end of the
year. So the instructors, Mr Chritensen and Dowliny told me that they

Peoples meeting and Sunday School.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">They had a social show in town so I got up courage
enough to ask her if she would go with me. She said yes so we started
going together and they got me to join the choir. I started dating
her heavily and when we got to her place after the date we would sit
in the car and talk before she went in.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">They had a catholic priest that lived next to them
and he appointed himself as watchdog to keep an eye on us. He would
walk up and down the street by the car but we didn&rsquo;t need him.
Anyway he seemed to think he was doing a good service so we didn&rsquo;t
mind.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I hadn&rsquo;t been down to Salt Lake for many
years so she and I went down to see her folks that lived there and
her uncle Ross and Aunt Flo were visiting there too so they took us
around to show us the city.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We wound up going to the fort to see it, which we
weren&rsquo;t supposed to be able to do. There wasn&rsquo;t anyone at
the gate so we went driving in. When we went to go out the other end
we were stopped by a big soldier with a rifle in his hands. He wanted
to know what we were doing in there an uncle Ross told him that we
weren&rsquo;t stopped at the entrance and we thought that it was
still open to visitors. <I>The guard</I> said, &ldquo;No way!&rdquo;
so he held us there until he phoned the man in charge and finally let
us go <I>with instructions </I>&ldquo;not to come back unless we had
a pass.&rdquo; So we made it out without being thrown in the guard
house.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We drove back home and set the date the second
time for October and pulled it off that time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">My folks gave us a reception because her sister
went and got married without any fuss and without giving much notice.
Her father said that if it was good enough for her it was good enough
for whomever. Gerry wanted to have a church wedding so we did.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I had Walter Rhinehart for my best man and she had
her girlfriend for her bridesmaid. <I>The bridesmaid</I> had a bad
foot at the time and Walter had injured his hand and had it wrapped
up. So we not only had them crippled but the wedding was delayed
because Gerry&rsquo;s grandmother had fallen and broke her arm as she
was getting out of the car to come to the church.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">She and <I>Gerry&rsquo;s</I> aunts had come up for
the occasion so the day wasn&rsquo;t what you would call a total
success but we managed to make it through.</P>

MARRIED LIFE</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We first rented an apartment on Harrison St but it
was so drafty that we moved to another upstairs apartment on
Garfield. We finally found another house on south ninth where we
stayed for a few years until the Smiths, who owned it, sold out and
we had to move.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">While there Andy and Raymond were born and grew
big enough to run off every so often. I know that the police were
glad to see us move out of the town because I never knew when they
were going to call and tell me that they had taken off again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I had to pay for a windshield that some motorist
said the my kids and the neighbors had thrown rocks at.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The young people of the church were going on a
picnic at Mack&rsquo;s Inn and we went along. Dad and I had a trailer
and I was taking the camping stuff up in it. We got part way up there
when one of the wheel bearings broke and we had to tie everything on
the car and leave the trailer at a farmer&rsquo;s place until we
could come back with parts to fix it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The others were getting worried by the time we got
up there with their stuff but we made it in time to get everything
set up before nightfall. But we got a scare because Raymon had to go
to the toilet so I took him and showed him where it was and told him
to come right back to camp. I went back to finish putting up the
tent.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When he never showed up we went looking for him
but no Raymon. We started forming a search party to look for him when
one of our party came and said he was at the inn. Some people saw him
trotting up the highway and picked him up and brought him back to the
inn.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We were all relieved to find him and when we went
to get him, him he had a bag of popcorn they had bought for him and
so he faired alright. When he came out <I>of the toilet</I> he got
confused and took off the wrong way. We got through the rest of the
stay without anymore troubles and went home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The next weekend I took up a bearing and got the
trailer.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">My father-in-law moved to Idaho Falls and ran a
secondhand store for a man to earn <I>money</I>. He would buy up
stuff that people had to sell on his own and laid it away so he could
go into business on his own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">He rented an apartment on the third floor of an
apartment building and we had to pack all that stuff up the stairs.
Bob, Florence&rsquo;s husband and I got in on that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Gerry&rsquo;s sister <I>was</I> Florence <I>and
her</I> husband was Bob Braga and we were sure glad to get that job
done and after a while Lee went into business on his own only I
didn&rsquo;t get in on packing all that stuff down again.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Lee loved the secondhand business and he was good
at it. He could skin a person and feel good about it, which is one of
the qualifications you have to have in that trade. 
</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Then he bought an apartment house across the
tracks and we stayed with them whenever we went up to see them. When
the train came rolling through, it seemed as though it was coming
right through the house. It shook everything.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Lee wanted both Bob and I to go in business with
him but we couldn&rsquo;t see it and he finally sold out and decided
he was going to become a minister. So he went east to a college and
Florence&rsquo;s mother moved in with them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in"><I>While at college, Lee</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
gave up </SPAN><I>the ministry</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
and found his relatives in Oklahoma. It turned out that he had been
going under an assumed name because he had been d</SPAN>rafted in the
first world war and decided it wasn&rsquo;t for him. <A CLASS="sdfootnoteanc" NAME="sdfootnote4anc" HREF="#sdfootnote4sym"><SUP>4</SUP></A>So
he went over the hill and changed his name from Jesse Lee Davidson to
Lee Davis. He was a swell guy to us and helped us a lot.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000">My
wife was pregnant with our third child to be named after his
grandfather, Jesse. Viola and Ole were going on the move as she was
going back to teaching school and we moved out on the farm. We
finally bought the place from them and they traded the paper for a
place on Yellowstone Avenue in Pocatello. Then they started buying
property there.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">My wife, Geraldine, wrote a summary of her life
but I never got to read it. After she was gone I was never able to
find it. So I will try to fill in for her with what I remember she
told us from time to time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">She was born in Salt Lake on June 26<SUP>th</SUP>,
1921. When she was born she said that they gave her up as dead and
concentrated on saving her mother. Her grandmother, who was in
attendance asked them what they were going to do with the kid because
she was alright so they brought her out of it and her mother made it
through alright also.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Her mother told us about the time she went to town
shopping and had Gerry in the buggy. They got interested in looking
through the store and left the buggy parked. When they left they were
walking down the street when the woman with her said, &ldquo;Didn't
we have a baby with us when we went into the store? Her mother said,
&ldquo;Heavens yes!&rdquo; So they hurried back to the store to get
her much to the relief of the store clerks who thought they were
stuck with a baby.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Gerry said her mother went looking for her one
day, after she had grown a little, and found her at the top of a
light pole and had a hard time coaxing her down.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">She said her father had a store in Salt Lake and
when they went to a show they would take extra cash with them to buy
candy, something which they had plenty of back home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">She said that her father had a baseball and they
spent most of their Saturdays at the baseball field.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Business wasn't very good so her father packed up
his family and went to New York and down to Florida where he went
into the store business again. But after a year there he decided to
come west to Pocatello where he went to work for a furniture store
and later ran the second hand part of it.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Gerry and her sister went to grade school in Salt
Lake and finished out their schooling in Pocatello where Gerry went
two years at the University of Idaho. She and her sister joined the
Christian church where I met her. She worked part time for some
people who were both working, so she said.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Well the war started soon after we got married and
they called me up and I went before the board. I asked them if they
would give me time enough to move my family to Idaho Falls to live
with her folks. They told me to go home and they would get in touch
with me. I never heard from them for several months and in the
meantime I had an operation for appendicitis. Then they wouldn't take
me because the head doctor said it hadn't been long enough since the
operation.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I didn't hear from them for a couple of months and
then they wanted me to join the Sea Bees. So I went to Boise for a
physical and the lead navy doctor saw that I had a back injury and he
wouldn't take me. I wasn't bothered anymore after that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Then Raymon came along and later the Smiths that
owned the house sold out and we had to move.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">But before that, while Gerry was pregnant with
Jesse, Viola and her husband Ole told us to bring Andy and Ramon out
to stay with them while Gerry was in the hospital so we did.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in"><FONT SIZE=3>While they were there, they came in
the house really sick and throwing up. Ramon was so sick that Viola
threatened to whale the day lights out of Andy if he didn't tell her
what they had been doing. Well it turns out they had been playing
horse and eating off the hay rack they had been using to haul with
out in the field. It was covered with chicken manure. They finally
put some whiskey down Ramon which counteracted the poison he had in
him. It settled him down so they could move him around. They lived
through it alright but it scared them for awhile. Viola never let
them near anything like it again.</FONT></P>

VACATION</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">In 46 we took a vacation and the folks said that
they would pay our expenses if we would take our car and go back to
Kansas to see the folks there. We took off and drove to Concordia
through Wyoming and Colorado. We got into Denver too late to get gas
so we waited until morning. Ramon saw the trolley cars and called
them Charley cars. We made it to uncle Charley's that day and they
were glad to see us because they had been expecting us a day earlier.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">While in Concordia we saw our relatives there,
cousin May and her family, uncle Harry and uncle Floyd on mother's
side and then we went to Clay Center. At Clay Center we saw aunts
Ada, Estelle, Florence and uncle Ed, dad's youngest brother. Next we
went to Greenland and saw dad's cousins and cousin Albert Sparman.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We had a good time on the trip despite some tire
trouble on the car and the trailer we were pulling.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I don't know whether Andy or Ray remembers any of
it or not but it was a good thing because the next year two of them
died so we got to see them before they did.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">After Jesse was born, his mother and the boys went
down to Phoenix to see her father who was living down there at that
time.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">After they came back, we moved out to the ranch
with Viola and Ole. Viola went back to teaching school again and I
was having a hard time getting a steady job lined up after being laid
off from the garage in Pocatello.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I worked for a man in Blackfoot that couldn't pay
me which didn't help out much. I finally got a job with Mountain
State Implement Company which was a steady job but their rate of pay
wasn't too hot.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We went on vacation to Yellowstone Park and had a
good time. While there, I remember one night while we were asleep, in
our car which made down into a bed, the car began to shake and bounce
all around. Well, a bear had gotten into the trunk which wasn't
locked. He was after our food and the trunk lid had fallen down on
him and he was for getting out of there. He did take our grub box out
on the road and I had to rescue as much of it as I could. I threw a
box of cookies at him that he had busted open to keep him busy while
I secured the rest of it. We were running short of food so we decided
to go home a couple of days early.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When we got home Gerry's dad was sitting on the
back porch waiting for us to come back. He stayed with us for awhile
then went back to Phoenix. It was shortly after this that he decided
he wanted to be by himself and he divided up the property and went
out on his own.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Gerry's mother went to live with Florence in
Seattle and he finally wound up in San Bernardino, California where
he lived until his death. He was good to all of us but he had some
queer ideas that we couldn't understand. But I guess we are all that
way to others. We went down to see him while he was down there and
helped him out while he was sick once.</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="font-style: normal; font-weight: medium; text-indent:0.2in">
<FONT FACE="Arial Narrow, sans-serif" COLOR="#000000">The
last time we went down we drove the car down and went to Disneyland
and the Marine World. While we were down there, the kids seemed to
enjoy it. Fred was just a little fellow and I took him around while
Jesse and Ray went their ways at the different places. I was holding
him in front of a window at Marine World and a big old ugly grouper
came swimming by right close to the window and it scared him to
death. He wouldn't get next to one anymore.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I got laid off in Pocatello and hard times set in
for a couple of years because we were having a slump in business. I
got a job at a garage in Blackfoot that didn't pay off for me because
they couldn't pay me. I got a job with the Buick garage and after a
year I quit there and went to work for the Blackfoot Implement
Company. After awhile they had a blowup between the management and
the foreman of the shop and we all had to quit there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">So I went to work for the Mountain States
Implement Company and worked there for twelve years all told. I quit
there because they wouldn't give me a raise and went to work for a
farmer out on the desert for a year. Mountain States Implement said
that if I would come back to work for them they would give me what I
wanted so I worked there until they quit the implement business. Then
I went to work for the Bingham County Road and Bridge until I
retired.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I tried to get into the dairy business by buying
some cows from the Kraft Cheese Company but it didn't work out
because I had hard luck with the cows and I couldn't get any money to
buy feed with. It took everything I could rake up to make payments on
the cows and I couldn't get anyone to help me with the work so I gave
it up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When we first came here, Andy got off the school
bus at the wrong place and attempted to take a short cut through the
fields and got lost which caused a lot of worry for his mother until
he showed up with a neighbor. But that was the last time that he took
off for any reason which was a relief for his mother and all the rest
of us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We got acquainted with some of the neighbors and
as I went around working on the farmer's machinery we got acquainted
with more.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">At times I took my with me on trips away from home
whenever she could go with with me. We went one year to Big Wood
River on our vacation and Andy got some hot grease off the fire on
his arm and hand. It scared us and we were afraid it would wreck his
hand but outside of being painful to him for awhile, it was alright.</P>

NEIGHBORS THE HALLERS</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We had some people move into John Williams little
house up the road and they had seven little kids, two goats and a
couple of dogs. He was in the army but not to bright because he had
been in for eleven years and was still a buck private. Their last
name was Haller and she was a Spanish Mexican and a real nice looking
woman. She wasn't too bright either but she did have him beat. We
helped them out as much as we could and the next year he got out of
the army. They stayed at the same place and he worked here and there
when he wanted to. He came down right after he got home from the army
and was going to go back and see his mother who was sick. He got
Gerry and Mrs. Brown to take him to the airport at Idaho Falls to
catch a plane. He said he was taking one of the boys with him but
when they got him there they found out that he only had one dollar to
buy tickets with. So they didn't have any with them so they brought
him home.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">His wife and his kids joined the LDS church and
that Christmas they didn't have anything to buy the kids anything for
Christmas. The bishop said that he wasn't helping anyone that didn't
help out on the church farm. So we went to town and got each one of
the kids something. The next day we found out that the bishop had
thought it over and decided that he wasn't doing right and he went to
town and got them something. So they had a pretty good Christmas at
that.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">That spring the Elders of the church who had been
buying food for them at the store got him a job at the implement
house at Rockford and he worked there fine for two weeks. Then he got
so he didn't do much of anything and they had to let him go.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">He always imagined he was a truck driver and
talked about going to Oregon and getting a job driving. One day we
drove by their place and their two old cars hey had were gone.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">My wife said, &ldquo;I'll bet the Hallers have
left the country.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I said, &ldquo;How come?&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">She said, &ldquo;Because both cars are gone.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Sure enough they had pulled out in the middle of
the night without letting anyone know. One of the Elders came to
visit us and wanted to know where the Hallers went and we told him
his guess was as good as ours.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">He said, &ldquo;We have got quite a bit invested
in them.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in"><FONT SIZE=3>But they weren't the only ones. There
was a few more of us in the same boat, not that we expected any
repayment but we did have the children's welfare in mind.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">They lived in the house but never did pay any rent
to John. He didn't mind that as long as they didn't carry off the
place.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We came home from town one time and the wife went
into the house first. One of their kids had gotten in the house
through the back door and left the door open. Their goat was in the
kitchen standing in the middle of the table. Whenever the kids would
go to a place, they would go through it and leave it in a shambles.
But then that was the way they were brought up.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I have often wondered what happened to them but no
one ever heard from them again. Their kids are all grown by now if
they managed to survive.</P>

MISCELLANEOUS MEMORIES</B></FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">When Andy and Ray were in high school they told me
they wanted a job that summer. I told them I would look out for one
for them although I was a little skeptical. I couldn't get them to do
much at home but when I was on a job out at Rising River I asked one
of the fellows of the W2 ranch if he knew of anyone who needed pipe
movers.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">He said, &ldquo;Yes, I do. Send them out.&rdquo;</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">Well we took them out and told them that they were
there for the duration. They lived in a boxcar and had to get their
own meals. When we left I had my fingers crossed because they had to
get up at four in the morning to move their first pipes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I checked with their boss after a week and he told
me that he was well pleased with them. He said, &ldquo;I only have to
call them once and they are up and about their work.&rdquo; But when
they got through with their pipes they would come back, eat their
breakfast and lay down and sleep some more. Their boss, a little
Japanese man, told them that they were going to rot their eyeballs
out if they didn't quit it. But he was awfully good to them.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">They stuck it out and Ray had quite a time of it
because he wasn't as sharp as Andy at it. The poor kid got bossed
around a lot to which he objected. I couldn't blame him. He figured
he got bossed around a lot at home too but we never knew what his
thinking was because he would never open up and tell you what was on
his mind or what was wrong. That part we had to guess and in doing so
we were doing wrong, not intentionally but just dumbly.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">I hope they they don't have to do the same thing
with their children as it is a constant worry as to know what to do.
We didn't have just one but two because the youngest one does the
same thing. If I can just get him on his own and going straight
before I leave this world, I'll think I have done something.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">We took a trip to San Bernardino to see Lee,
Gerry's father, and while we were there we stayed at a vacant house
that one of his friends had. He invited us to his house that he was
living in because he was a bachelor, to watch TV. But you didn't get
to see much because he would keep switching from one channel to
another about every two minutes.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">After we left there, we went to see Knox Berry
Farms and from there to Disneyland and then to the Marine World. We
also went to Gerry's aunt Flo and uncle Ross and from there to her
aunt in Elko, Nevada. Then we went to Dietrich to see Walter
Rhinehart and his wife and then back home. Andy was in the Navy at
the time so he wasn't with us.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">The boys have all attended Snake River schools and
went on from there. But I am going to let them take it from there.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">After awhile my wife came down with cancer of the
lung and was taken from us but I thank the Lord for all the wonderful
years we had together. She was a wonderful wife and mother. Although
she, like me, had a hard time trying to figure out her kids. Her
mother's English showed up at times and perhaps some of the
nationalities of her father who would only say that he was a little
bit of everything and so be it. Of course, none of my English,
Scotch, Irish or German Dutch showed up in any of the kids unless it
was on their good side. You don't have to believe that if you don't
want to.</P>
<P CLASS="western" style="text-indent: 0.2in">My grandfather Smullin was English and his wife
German Dutch. My grandfather Anderson was Scotch and his wife Irish.
My great aunt Ella, I was told, traced their side of the family to
some English princes of long ago but I don't know who has that
history. But if it exists, it is probably held by her grandchildren
and I don't know how to contact any of them. Their father died and I
imagine that his wife has remarried but I think I will try and
contact her through the last address I have.</P>
